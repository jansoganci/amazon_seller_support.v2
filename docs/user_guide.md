#### 3. Understanding Results

##### Sales Peaks
The system automatically identifies sales peaks, which are periods where your sales are significantly higher than usual. A peak is marked when:

##### Holiday Performance
Special periods like Black Friday and Christmas are automatically analyzed:
- Comparison with previous years
- Growth rate calculation
- Performance metrics

##### Growth Patterns
The system identifies three types of patterns:
1. **Consistent Growth**: Periods showing steady increase
2. **Seasonal Peaks**: Regular high-performance periods
3. **Declining Periods**: Areas needing attention

#### 4. Taking Action

Use these insights to:
- Plan inventory for peak seasons
- Optimize pricing during high-demand periods
- Schedule promotions during typically slow periods
- Set realistic growth targets
