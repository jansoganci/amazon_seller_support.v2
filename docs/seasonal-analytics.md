# Seasonal Analytics Documentation

## Overview

The Seasonal Analytics module provides comprehensive analysis of sales patterns, peak periods, and special events for Amazon sellers. This document outlines the technical implementation, usage guidelines, and key features of the module.

## Features

### 1. Seasonal Trend Detection

- Monthly, quarterly, and yearly trend analysis
- Growth rate calculation and significance testing
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Automated trend classification (up, down, stable)

### 2. Peak Period Analysis

- Automatic detection of high-sales periods
- Comparison with historical data
- Duration and intensity metrics
- Classification of peak types (holiday, promotion, organic)

### 3. Special Period Tracking

- Pre-defined special periods (Black Friday, Christmas)
- Custom period definition support
- Performance metrics for special periods
- Year-over-year growth analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Analytics Engine

```python
class AnalyticsEngine:
    def analyze_seasonal_trends(self, store_id, date_range):
        """Analyzes seasonal trends for the given store and date range."""
        pass

    def detect_peak_periods(self, store_id, sensitivity=0.8):
        """Detects peak sales periods using configurable sensitivity."""
        pass

    def analyze_special_periods(self, store_id, period_definitions):
        """Analyzes performance during defined special periods."""
        pass
```

### Data Processing

- Raw data aggregation by time periods
- Moving average calculations
- Statistical significance testing
- Outlier detection and handling

### Visualization

- Interactive charts using Chart.js
- Trend line overlays
- Peak period highlighting
- Special period markers

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Accessing Analytics

1. Select a store from the dropdown
2. Choose the desired date range
3. View the generated analytics on the dashboard

### 2. Interpreting Results

- **Trend Significance**

  - High: Strong statistical evidence
  - Medium: Moderate evidence
  - Low: Weak or inconclusive evidence

- **Peak Classification**
  - Strong: >50% above baseline
  - Moderate: 25-50% above baseline
  - Weak: 10-25% above baseline

### 3. Best Practices

- Use at least 12 months of data for reliable trends
- Consider external factors (promotions, market changes)
- Regularly update data for accurate analysis

## API Integration

### Endpoints

- GET `/api/v1/analytics/seasonal/<store_id>`
- Parameters and responses detailed in [API Documentation](api.md)

### Example Usage

```javascript
async function fetchSeasonalAnalytics(storeId) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/analytics/seasonal/${storeId}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  updateDashboard(data);
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Machine learning-based trend prediction
2. Advanced seasonality pattern detection
3. Integration with external market data
4. Customizable analysis parameters

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Data Available**

   - Check if store is selected
   - Verify data upload status
   - Ensure date range has data

2. **Inconsistent Results**
   - Verify data quality
   - Check for missing periods
   - Review outlier handling settings
